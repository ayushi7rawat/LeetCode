Problem Statement:
==========================
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Example 1:
==========================
```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
==========================
```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```

Example 3:
==========================
```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```

Follow Up:
==========================
```
Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.
```

Hint 1:
==========================
```
Think about how you would solve the problem in non-constant space. Can you apply that logic to the existing space?
```

Hint 2:
==========================
```
We don't care about duplicates or non-positive integers
```

Hint 3:
==========================
```
Remember that O(2n) = O(n)
```
