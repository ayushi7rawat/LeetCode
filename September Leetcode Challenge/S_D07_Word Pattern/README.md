Problem Statement:
==========================
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Example 1
==========================
```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

```

Example 2
==========================
```
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

```

Example 3
==========================
```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

```

Example 4
==========================
```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false

```

Note:
==========================
```
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
```
