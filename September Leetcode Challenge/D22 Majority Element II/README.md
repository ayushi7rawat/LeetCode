Problem Statement:
==========================
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Example 1:
==========================
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

Example 2:
==========================
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

Note:
==========================
```
The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.
```

Hint:
==========================
```
How many majority elements could it possibly have?
Do you have a better hint? Suggest it!
