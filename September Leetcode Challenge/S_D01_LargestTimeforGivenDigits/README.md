Given an array of 4 digits, return the largest 24 hour time that can be made.

The smallest 24 hour time is 00:00, and the largest is 23:59.  Starting from 00:00, a time is larger if more time has elapsed since midnight.

Return the answer as a string of length 5.  If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: "23:41"
Example 2:

Input: [5,5,5,5]
Output: ""
 

Note:

A.length == 4
0 <= A[i] <= 9
